/**
 * Cut a release: gate locally, then hand the build to GitHub Actions.
 *
 * One command — `pnpm release` — checks that this machine's tree deserves a
 * release and pushes the tag that makes `.github/workflows/release.yml` build
 * it: every platform on its own native runner, boot-verified, published as one
 * GitHub release with the per-arch update feeds.
 *
 *   1. clean tree, on main, up to date gates
 *   2. typecheck + full test suite (CI runs them again; failing here is
 *      simply faster than failing there)
 *   3. git tag vX.Y.Z, push main + tag → Actions takes it from here
 *
 * The version is read from apps/desktop/package.json — bump it there first.
 * Release notes are `.github/RELEASE_NOTES.md`, versioned with the code.
 *
 * ## Betas
 *
 * There is no separate command and no separate branch. A version with a
 * prerelease suffix — `1.0.0-beta.1` — is a beta, and every step downstream
 * reads it off the number: `release.yml` passes `--prerelease` to `gh release
 * create`, GitHub keeps it out of `/releases/latest`, and only installations
 * that have turned the beta channel on in Settings → Advanced are offered it.
 * A beta is the same commit as the release it rehearses, tagged earlier.
 *
 * This script used to build and publish from the local machine. It stopped
 * because a laptop can only build its own platform: the Agent SDK ships one
 * native binary per platform and pnpm installs only the host's, so the
 * Windows and Intel artifacts have to come from runners that *are* those
 * platforms.
