/**
 * Headless Artemis.
 *
 * One binary, four verbs:
 *
 *   artemis-server serve                       — bind and answer until signalled
 *   artemis-server profile add <label> ...     — register a serving account
 *   artemis-server connection create ...       — mint a token (prints it once)
 *   artemis-server connection list|revoke ...  — inspect and retract grants
 *
 * Configuration is environment-first, because the process is built to live in
 * a container:
 *
 *   ARTEMIS_DATA_DIR       where profiles.json, server.json, the session
 *                          ledger and the profile config directories live.
 *                          Default: ~/.artemis-server
 *   ARTEMIS_BIND_HOST      interface to bind. Default 127.0.0.1; a container
 *                          sets 0.0.0.0 and lets its published port and the
 *                          network in front of it govern reachability.
 *   ARTEMIS_PORT           overrides server.json's port when set.
 *   ARTEMIS_ALLOWED_HOSTS  comma-separated Host-header names to answer to,
 *                          or `any`. Defaults to `any` when the bind host is
 *                          not loopback — the Host check is DNS-rebinding
 *                          protection for loopback binds, and a deliberately
 *                          reachable server is guarded by its bind + auth.
 *
 * Two more govern the runs a completions client detaches from — a laptop that
 * slept mid-turn — and both are ceilings rather than schedules. Neither applies
 * to a caller that did not ask for the behaviour; see `ArtemisRemoteOptions`.
 * Neither governs a *bridge*-started run either, which has its own sixty-second
 * grace in `server/guard.ts`.
 *
 *   ARTEMIS_DETACHED_RUN_TTL_MS   how long a run nobody has come back for is
 *                          kept before it is interrupted and disposed.
 *                          Default 6h. The clock restarts every time the
 *                          owning connection touches the run, so a client
 *                          that is polling is never reaped mid-read.
 *   ARTEMIS_PERMISSION_PARK_MS    how long a permission prompt waits for an
 *                          answer, while a client is attached, before it is
 *                          denied with the standing "nobody is here" message.
 *                          Off by default: a question waits for the person
 *                          it was asked of, bounded only by the run's own
 *                          deadline above. Set it for clients that ask for
 *                          prompts they will never answer.
 *
 * And one for deployments that cannot run this CLI interactively at all:
 *
 *   ARTEMIS_BOOTSTRAP_CONNECTIONS   a JSON array of connections to make sure
 *                          exist, merged into server.json at startup. For
 *                          orchestrated deploys — Swarm, Nomad, a PaaS — where
 *                          there is no shell to run `connection create` in and
 *                          therefore no way to mint the *first* token, leaving
 *                          the server reachable by nobody. Idempotent; the CLI
 *                          remains the interactive path and the file remains
 *                          the truth for every connection this does not name.
 *                          See `config.ts`.
 *   ARTEMIS_SIGNIN_TIMEOUT_MS   how long a sign-in driven from a client waits
 *                          for the person to finish before the login
 *                          subprocess is killed. Default 10m. See
 *                          `server/signin.ts` in core.
 *
 * Every request still authenticates with a connection token; nothing here
 * relaxes that. See the core ledger for how sessions are scoped per token.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SIGNING AN ACCOUNT IN, FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `profile add` registers an account and prints the login command to run
 * *inside this environment* — which assumes a shell inside this environment.
 * The same orchestrated deployments that cannot mint the first token cannot run
 * that command either, so a connection may be granted account administration
 * (`connection create --manage-profiles`, or `"manageProfiles": true` in
 * `ARTEMIS_BOOTSTRAP_CONNECTIONS`) and drive the login over HTTP from a desktop
 * Artemis instead. The grant is off unless asked for, and it is the only thing
 * that makes those routes visible — see `ServerConnection.manageProfiles`.
