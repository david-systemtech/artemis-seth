/**
 * Session history, arranged for the sidebar.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The sidebar shows every past session grouped by the project directory it ran
 * in. That ordering is the whole feature, so it lives here as pure functions
 * over `SessionSummary[]` rather than inside a component: it is the part most
 * worth testing, and the part a virtualised list must be able to recompute
 * without touching the DOM.
 *
 * The rules, in the order the UI depends on them:
 *
 *  1. One group per **project**, which is the session's `cwd` resolved through
 *     {@link GroupOptions.projectOf} — see below.
 *  2. Groups are ordered by name, and **do not move**. See the note below.
 *  3. Sessions inside a group are ordered newest first.
 *     "Newest" is {@link GroupOptions.orderKey}, which defaults to `updatedAt`
 *     and is overridden by the sidebar to hold a running session still. See
 *     `AppState.sessionOrderHold`: `updatedAt` is the transcript file's mtime,
 *     so ordering several working agents by it reshuffles the list every few
 *     seconds. Nothing here knows about runs — it takes a key and sorts by it.
 *  4. A session belongs to a **profile as well as a directory**, and two
 *     profiles can have sessions in the same directory. Grouping is therefore
 *     by directory only, and the profile is carried per row. Grouping by
 *     (cwd, profile) instead would split one project into two headers with the
 *     same path, which reads as a bug.
 *
 * Ties are broken by session id everywhere, so the order is total and a render
 * never reshuffles rows that compare equal.
 *
 * ## Why the projects hold still while their rows do not
 *
 * Groups used to sort by their newest session, which put the project you were
 * last in at the top. That reads well in a screenshot and badly in use: every
 * prompt in any project rewrites the order of the whole sidebar, so the heading
 * someone was reaching for slides out from under the pointer, and a project
 * worked in twice a week is somewhere different every time it is looked for.
 * Reported directly — the folders were asked to stay put while their contents
 * moved.
 *
 * The two levels answer different questions, which is why they now sort
 * differently. *Which project* is navigation, and navigation wants furniture
 * that stays where it was put: a name, sorted the way anyone would guess, moving
 * only when a project is added or goes away. *Which session inside it* is
 * recency, because within one project the thing you want is nearly always the
 * thing you touched last.
 *
 * Sorted by the **displayed** name — the last path segment, which is what the
 * heading shows — rather than the full path, so the list reads in the order it
 * looks like it is in. `/code/api` and `/work/api` both read as `api`, so the
 * full path breaks the tie and keeps the order total.
 *
 * Pinned and Archived are unaffected: both are nailed to an end of the list and
 * neither has ever competed for position.
 *
 * ## Two sections stand outside the projects
 *
 * A **pinned** session and an **archived** one both leave their project — one to
 * a section above every heading, the other to a section below every heading —
 * because a row that stayed in place and merely changed appearance is a row the
 * user still has to find. Both are flat lists spanning every project, both are
 * lifted out by {@link partitionSessions} before grouping happens, and both
 * vanish when they hold nothing. See {@link SessionSection}.
 *
 * ## A project is not a directory
 *
 * Grouping by `cwd` alone files a session under the folder it ran in, which is
 * the same thing as the project only when the two happen to coincide. They stop
 * coinciding the moment work is split into a **linked worktree**: `.claude/
 * worktrees/some-branch` is a different directory, so an afternoon's work on
 * Artemis appeared in the sidebar as a repository called `some-branch` and left
 * the Artemis group it belonged to. Sessions in a subdirectory of a repository
 * split the same way, for the same reason.
 *
 * So the key is whatever {@link GroupOptions.projectOf} says a directory belongs
 * to — the main checkout for a worktree, the repository root for a directory
 * inside one — and the `cwd` only when it says nothing. Resolving that needs the
 * filesystem, which the renderer does not have, so the answer arrives from the
 * main process a moment after the rows do (see `projectRoots` in the store).
 * Until it does, every session groups by its own directory, which is where this
 * module started and remains a correct-looking list rather than an empty one.
 *
 * ## Row keys are `profileId + id`, not `id`
 *
 * `SessionsListAllResponse` says so explicitly: a session id is unique inside
 * the profile that owns it, not globally, because each profile has its own
 * provider config directory. Two profiles could in principle surface the same
 * id, and duplicate React keys inside one list silently drop a row.
 *
 * ## A third way out of a project: a group the user made
 *
 * Everything above files a session somewhere the *machine* decided — the
 * directory it ran in, or one of the two shelves at the ends of the list. That
 * is the right default and the wrong only option, and the case that proves it
 * is an Artemis Server: every conversation held on one shares a single working
 * directory, so the entire server's history lands under one heading with no way
 * to tell a week of unrelated work apart.
 *
 * So there is a fourth kind of section — see {@link CustomGroup} — holding
 * whatever the user dragged into it, from any project, filed by the same
 * `sessionKey` values pins and the archive use. Groups sit between Pinned and
 * the project headings, keep their stored order, and lift their members out of
 * the project list exactly the way pinning does. Pinned and Archived still win:
 * a grouped session that is also pinned shows under Pinned, because the two
 * shelves are about *where your attention is* and a group is about how the
 * history is filed, and only one of those can have the row.

/**
 * Split a listing three ways: kept up front, filed under its project, put away.
 *
 * A separate step *before* grouping rather than a flag inside it, because a
 * pinned or archived session leaves its project entirely — an archived session
 * is not a hidden row in `/code/api`, it is a row in Archived, and a pinned one
 * is a row in Pinned. Filtering inside `groupSessionsByProject` would have to
 * special-case the group whose every member had left, and would leave the caller
 * no way to render the lifted rows at all.
 *
 * Pinned is tested first, so a session that somehow ended up in both sets is
 * kept rather than hidden. The store makes the two mutually exclusive — pinning
 * unarchives and archiving unpins, because "keep this in front of me" and "put
 * this away" cannot both be true — so this only decides what a hand-edited
 * preferences file does, and of the two answers, showing the row is the one the
 * user can act on.
 *
 * ## Scheduler firings are archived by rule, not by entry
 *
 * A row carrying `SessionSummary.spawnedBy` is a transcript a machine opened —
 * a scheduled task or routine firing — and it files under Archived without any
 * entry saying so. An entry could not do this job: firings arrive on a
 * schedule, each under a fresh id, so a list of the ones already put away is a
 * list that is wrong again by the next firing. The rule is what lets the store
 * a scheduler has been writing to for a month merge into the sidebar without
 * burying the conversations, and it is why archiving them by hand once —
 * which is how this feature was discovered missing — never needs doing again.
 *
 * Pinning still wins, deliberately: it is the one explicit "keep this in view"
 * a user can put on a firing they actually want to watch, and it already
 * outranks the archive for the same reason in the hand-edited-prefs case above.
 *
 * Keys are `sessionKey` values, not ids: see the note at the top of this file.
 * Membership, though, is tested more broadly than the keys are written — see
 * {@link entriesFiling} for how a shared row keeps its filing when the profile
 * half of a stored key goes stale.

 * right now?" from a scroll offset alone.
 *
 * A collapsed group contributes its header and none of its sessions. Dropping
 * the rows here rather than hiding them in CSS is what keeps the virtualiser
 * honest: its geometry is computed from this array, so a row that is present
 * but invisible would still take up its height and leave a hole in the list.
 * The header keeps the *full* count either way — the number is a fact about the
 * project, not about how much of it is currently on screen.
 *
 * ## The two flat sections bracket the projects
 *
 * Pinned goes above every project and Archived below every project, and neither
 * competes for position by recency: one is the shelf at eye level and the other
 * is the drawer under the desk, and furniture that wandered up and down the list
 * as its newest member aged would be neither. Both are absent entirely when
 * empty — a permanent "Pinned · 0" is a control for a state the user is not in.
 *
 * `sections` is one object rather than two trailing parameters because the order
 * these are *passed* has nothing to do with the order they are drawn in, and a
 * third positional argument that renders first would read as the opposite of
 * what it does.
 *
 * ## Custom groups sit between the pin shelf and the projects
 *
 * Below Pinned because a pin is the strongest claim in the list — "I am coming
 * back to this one" outranks "this is how I have filed my history" — and above
 * the projects because a group is something a person made and a project heading
 * is something the app inferred from a path. The furniture someone built by
 * hand goes at eye level; the furniture that was always there holds the rest.
 *
 * Unlike every other section, a group with nothing in it still draws its
 * heading: it is the drop target that puts the first session into it. See
 * {@link liftSessionGroups}.
