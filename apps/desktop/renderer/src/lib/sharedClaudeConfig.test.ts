/**
 * The shared-config scripts, run for real.
 *
 * The generator is a string builder, and a string builder can be asserted with
 * `toContain` all day while emitting shell that does the wrong thing. Every
 * claim this feature makes is a claim about a filesystem — "nothing is
 * deleted", "auth is untouched", "re-running is safe", "the undo puts it back"
 * — so the substantial tests here build a sandbox, point `HOME` at it, run the
 * generated script, and look at what is on disk afterwards.
 *
 * That is worth the cost because of what the script does when it is wrong. It
 * moves directories holding months of transcripts. The failure mode of a bad
 * quote is not a broken link, it is `mv` given two arguments it was not meant
 * to have — and the profile directory Artemis ships with by default lives under
 * `~/Library/Application Support`, which is to say every real invocation runs
 * through a path with a space in it. The sandbox reproduces that on purpose.
 *
 * Every suite that runs the script runs it once per shell on the machine — see
 * {@link SHELLS}, which is the other half of a bug this file used to pass.
 *
 * There are two scripts now, and they are tested the same way for the same
 * reason. The `/bin/sh` suites run wherever there is a shell to run them in; the
 * PowerShell suites run on Windows, where the arrangement is made out of
 * junctions and a hard link instead of symlinks and the claims that need
 * checking are correspondingly different — see {@link POWERSHELL}. Each half is
 * skipped where its interpreter is not, which is how one file covers a feature
 * whose implementation is genuinely two.
