/**
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 *
 * A finished run re-reads the account it just spent.
 *
 * The poll walks every profile serially — one CLI at a time, deliberately — so
 * with eight accounts any given one is re-read about every six minutes. That is
 * the blind window, and a run ending is the worst moment to be inside it.
 *
 * While the run was live, `planLoad`'s reservation covered it: the ranking knew
 * work was committed to that account even though the reading did not show it.
 * The moment it ends that cover is correctly withdrawn — and the account falls
 * back to being ranked on a reading taken *before any of the work happened*. So
 * it reads emptiest exactly when it has just been drained, and wins the next
 * session. That is the residual half of #146.
 *
 * What is asserted here is the trigger and its economy: the right account, once
 * per burst, after a settle, and never on the wrong event.
 *
 * Same caveat as the other state tests: `renderer/tsconfig.json` excludes test
 * files, so `pnpm typecheck` never sees this one and the assertions are
 * behavioural.
