/**
 * The three facts every model row knows.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The model picker used to be profile-blind: it offered Fable identically
 * whether that account's Fable weekly window was untouched or `rejected`.
 * Everything it should have known was already computed one selector away —
 * per-model exhaustion in the plan windows, plan headroom in `bindingWindow`,
 * relative burn rate in `MODEL_LOAD` — and simply never read. This module is
 * the join, and nothing but the join: pure functions from catalogue entries and
 * plan readings to the facts a row renders.
 *
 * Three surfaces consume it — the run navigator, the palette's models page and
 * Settings § Models — so the derivation lives here once rather than three
 * times. The §5 hand-off picker is expected to be the fourth caller.
 *
 * ## Identity goes through `modelIdentity`, never string equality
 *
 * Usage windows name models the way the provider displays them
 * (`model_scoped:Fable`); catalogues name them the way the CLI addresses them
 * (`claude-fable-5[1m]`, or `fable` in the built-in list). Comparing those
 * strings raw matches nothing, which is exactly the bug class
 * `modelIdentity`/`isSameModel` exist for. Every join below normalises both
 * sides through that helper and then matches on delimited name segments, the
 * same family logic `modelLoadFactor` documents.
