/**
 * Joining a served catalogue to the accounts behind it.
 *
 * An Artemis Server profile is one profile wearing several accounts: the
 * catalogue it serves flattens every account × model into routes
 * (`work-max/opus`), and its usage report keys gauges by the *serving side's*
 * profile id. Three places need to walk that join — the account rows in the
 * navigator, the model column that narrows to one account, and the status-bar
 * meter that names and measures the account behind the active pick — and each
 * had grown its own parsing of the route prefix and the note's wording. This
 * module is the one copy.
 *
 * Every reader here prefers the catalogue's explicit `account*` fields and
 * falls back to what older servers encode implicitly: the slug is the route
 * prefix, the label is the `"<account> — "` prefix the adapter writes into
 * every note. The fallbacks are load-bearing, not vestigial — a 2.4.3 server
 * sends none of the explicit fields.

 * A server's accounts, grouped by the provider each belongs to.

 * puts "switching account can switch CLI" in front of the person doing it. At a
 * server the same list arrived ungrouped, because the catalogue did not carry
 * the provider — the route prefix is an account slug and the model id is a
 * naming convention, so there was nothing to group *by*. With
 * `accountProviderId` on the option there is, and the two columns can say the
 * same thing the same way.
 *
 * Section order follows `providers` — the order `providers:list` reported —
 * so the sections do not reshuffle as accounts are signed in. A provider the
 * descriptor list does not name still gets a section, keyed by its raw id,
 * because an account is not worth hiding for belonging to a provider this
 * build has no adapter for; that is exactly when someone needs to see it.
 *
 * The single-section answer is deliberate rather than a special case. One
 * section is a heading over the whole list, which is chrome that says nothing,
 * so it comes back with a `null` label and the caller draws the rows bare —
 * the same list it drew before. That covers the common server (every account
 * on one provider) and the old server (no provider on any option) with one
 * rule instead of two.
