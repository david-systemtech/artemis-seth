/**
 * Which accounts could take this conversation, and why the rest cannot.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * A hand off moves a conversation to another profile (CONTEXT.md: "who runs
 * it"), and ADR 0003 makes the move a chosen act: the user is shown candidates
 * with live facts and picks one, or declines. This module is the *facts* half
 * of that — pure functions from a candidate's polled state to "may this row be
 * chosen, and if not, what is the honest sentence about why".
 *
 * The judgements are deliberately borrowed rather than invented:
 *
 *  - **Reachability** is `canReachSession`'s question, passed in as a predicate
 *    so this module needs no store import. A transcript lives in a config
 *    directory; an account whose directory does not reach that store cannot
 *    resume it, full stop.
 *  - **Freshness** is `actionable`'s bar — {@link PLAN_USAGE_MAX_AGE_MS}, the
 *    same six minutes the recommender and the hand-off trigger hold themselves
 *    to, and for the same reason: sending a conversation to an account is a
 *    claim about *right now*, and a reading three polls old may describe an
 *    account another machine has since drained.
 *  - **Auth** is `checkAuthStatus`'s answer, read from the window's cache. A
 *    probe that has answered "signed out" disables the row; a probe that has
 *    not answered yet reports `unchecked` so the caller can go and ask — the
 *    probe is cheap, and offering a move that fails on credentials after the
 *    user chose it would spend the trust the ADR is written to protect.
 *  - **Exhaustion** is the provider's own `rejected` verdict on the binding
 *    window. Handing work to an account that immediately stalls is the failure
 *    mode §5 names; a rejected account is shown struck through with its reset,
 *    never hidden (the `GatedItem` precedent), and never chooseable.
 *
 * What this module deliberately does **not** do is rank. `bindingWindow` is
 * workload-blind — a full Opus bucket sinks an account for Fable work — and
 * `drain-v1` (ACCOUNT-ROTATION-ALGORITHM.md) is unimplemented. Showing the
 * facts and letting the user choose *is* the design's answer to that
 * blindness, not a placeholder for it.
