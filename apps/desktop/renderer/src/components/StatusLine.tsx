/**
 * The status line.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * One always-visible row across the bottom of the window carrying everything
 * that decides what the *next* prompt will do, and nothing that does not:
 *
 *     [profile ▾] [model ▾] [mode ▾]     ended  5hr ⬤  Week ⬤  Fable ⬤  Ctx ⬤
 *
 * Everything left of the rings changes a setting in place; everything right of
 * them is read-only. That split is the whole design: a setting you can change
 * is a control, a fact about the run is text, and nothing here is both.
 *
 * ## The rings never give way
 *
 * A narrow column cannot hold all of that, and something has to yield. It
 * used to be the rings, and not by choice: every chip is a `Button`, whose
 * base classes carry `shrink-0`, so the meter was the one item on the row that
 * could shrink. It shrank to nothing and its rings ran off the column's right
 * edge, where the pane clips — Ctx first, then Fable, then the rest, and below
 * about 450px the `bypass` chip with them.
 *
 * So the order is now deliberate. The rings are `shrink-0` and give up
 * nothing. The profile and model chips truncate, with the run state beside
 * them — the profile at twice the rate, being the widest and the one whose
 * first words already say which account it is. The mode chip keeps its word,
 * for the reason its section gives. When the chips would be squeezed past
 * reading, the rings wrap onto a line of their own under them, rather than off
 * the edge.
 *
 * The rings open the usage popover, which carries the context window and the
 * plan's rate-limit windows together — both answer "how much room is left",
 * and they used to be split across two controls.
 *
 * ## Every list comes off the provider descriptor
 *
 * Profiles from `profiles:list`; models, effort levels and permission modes
 * from `providers:list`, with the model list preferring the live catalogue the
 * account actually reported (see `activeModels`). Not one of them is a literal
 * in this file. A second provider offers different models and a different
 * effort scale — quite possibly none at all — and a hard-coded list would show
 * Anthropic's options under a provider that has never heard of them. Where a
 * provider offers nothing, the segment renders **disabled with the reason
 * attached** rather than vanishing, which is the same rule every other degraded
 * control follows.
 *
 * ## The profile chip and the model chip open one navigator
 *
 * They used to open two menus, and the model one was profile-blind — it
 * offered Fable identically whether that account's Fable weekly window was
 * untouched or `rejected`. Both chips now open the run navigator
 * (`RunNavigator.tsx`): a Finder-column surface — Profile → Model → Effort —
 * whose model rows read the profile's plan, with fast mode, the permission
 * level, context and the plan meters in its footer. The chips stay, because
 * the bar's job is unchanged: everything that decides what the next prompt
 * does, readable without opening anything.
 *
 * The closed model trigger echoes the whole choice, not just the model: the
 * thinking level rides beside the name and the cyan zap appears when fast mode
 * is in force. "Sonnet 5" with ultracode armed and "Sonnet 5" on low are
 * different promises about time and money.
 *
 * ## The profile segment is the reason this work exists
 *
 * It names the profile, whether that profile is signed in, and the account it
 * is signed in as — because "which account is about to be charged" must be
 * answerable by looking rather than by opening an editor.
 *
 * There is no credential here to reveal or mask. A profile is a config
 * directory, the provider's own login put a credential inside it, and this bar
 * shows only what a status read reported. The amber state means *checked and
 * signed out*, never merely unchecked: a warning on a state nobody has looked
 * at is a warning the user learns to ignore.
 *
 * ## Why permission mode is here
 *
 * It is a fifth picker in a spec that named four, added deliberately. It is the
 * single most safety-relevant setting in the app: `bypassPermissions` runs every
 * tool call without asking, and a control that dangerous must be visible at all
 * times rather than folded into a command palette the user has to go looking
 * for. It is styled as the hazard it is when selected.
 *
 * ## It sits under the composer, not across the window
 *
 * These controls describe what the *prompt you are typing* will do, so they
 * line up with the input's edges rather than running the full width of a pane
 * the input does not fill. The measure is the transcript's own `COLUMN_MAX` —
 * messages, input and these chips share one column, so the three edges cannot
 * drift apart (they used to: this bar pinned itself to `max-w-4xl` while the
 * transcript read `max-w-5xl`, and the chips sat visibly inside the
 * conversation's margin). The composer draws the border above them; a second
 * one here would box the input in.
 *
 * The sidebar toggle used to ride along at the far left. The header carries it
 * now — it is always present, so this bar no longer needs a second copy.

 *
 * ## `...rest` is load-bearing, not tidiness
 *
 * Every use of this sits under `<DropdownMenuTrigger asChild>`, which renders a
 * Radix `Slot`: it clones this element and merges the trigger's own props onto
 * it — `onPointerDown`, `aria-expanded`, `data-state`, `id`, and the ref the
 * menu positions itself against. Because the immediate child of `Slot` is this
 * *component* rather than a DOM element, those props arrive here as ordinary
 * props and are only wired up if this component passes them on.
 *
 * An earlier version destructured the four props it cared about and dropped the
 * rest. It looked completely fine — the button rendered, styled correctly, took
 * focus — and not one of the four pickers opened, because the click handler had
 * been quietly thrown away. Keep the spread.
 *
 * `trailing` sits between the label and the chevron, *outside* the truncating
 * span. That placement is the reason the prop exists: `text-overflow` elides
 * text and nothing else, so an icon inside the span would be clipped mid-glyph
 * at the exact widths where truncation kicks in — the mark would break rather
 * than yield. Out here it is `shrink-0` by convention and the text gives way
 * instead.
 *
 * ## `shrink`, over the `Button`'s own `shrink-0`
 *
 * The chip is what gives way on a narrow row, so it has to be allowed to — see
 * "The rings never give way" at the top of this file. `overflow-hidden` is for
 * the far end of that: squeezed past its icon and chevron, a chip clips its
 * own content rather than painting it over the chip beside it. A caller that
 * must not yield passes `shrink-0` back, as the mode chip does.

 *
 * A machine that cannot confine will refuse to run commands at all, so the
