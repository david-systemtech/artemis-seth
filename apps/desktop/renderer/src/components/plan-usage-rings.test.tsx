/**
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 *
 * The status bar's three rings.
 *
 * The meter used to be one bar reporting one window, chosen in settings, and
 * the setting was the tell: the 5-hour limit, the weekly limit and the
 * per-model weekly answer different questions on different clocks, so picking
 * between them meant being blind to two. Three rings report all three.
 *
 * What is worth testing is the slot resolution rather than the drawing. Which
 * window lands in which ring is where this can be quietly wrong — a ring
 * showing the weekly number under a "5hr" label, or a permanent dash under
 * "Fable" on an account that meters Opus — and none of that is visible from the
 * geometry. The arc itself is one `stroke-dasharray` and is asserted only where
 * a zero-length one used to paint a dot.
 *
 * Same caveat as its siblings: `renderer/tsconfig.json` excludes test files, so
 * `pnpm typecheck` never sees this one and the assertions are behavioural.
