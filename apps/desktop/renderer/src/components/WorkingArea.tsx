 *
 * ## Rows of columns, not a matrix
 *
 * The grid is a list of rows, each holding its own panes — see `PaneRow` in
 * `state/pane.ts`. That is what puts a third conversation *across the bottom*
 * of a left/right pair instead of quartering the window: splitting downwards
 * adds a full-width row, and splitting that row's pane rightwards is what makes
 * the two-by-two. Within the ceiling (`MAX_PANES`) every arrangement is
 * reachable — a row of them, a stack of them, a square, or a pair over a
 * full-width third — and none needs an empty cell to stay rectangular.
 *
 * Reachable is not the same as usable: `SPLIT_MIN_WIDTH` is a pixel floor, so a
 * window's worth of panes all in one row runs out of width long before it runs
 * out of the pane budget, and the stacked shapes are what a full window
 * actually looks like. The grid does not enforce that — "will this fit on this
 * display" is a question about the window, not about the layout model.
 *
 * Structurally that is a vertical `ResizablePanelGroup` of rows, each row a
 * horizontal group of panes. A row holding one pane renders no inner group at
 * all — a group with a single panel is a divider with nothing to divide — which
 * also keeps the ordinary single-conversation window free of the library's DOM
 * entirely.
 *
 * ## The dividers are `react-resizable-panels`, through shadcn's `resizable`
 *
 * Rather than the hand-rolled pointer maths the sidebar's handle uses. The
 * sidebar resizes one element against the window edge; these resize panels
 * against each other, with a keyboard path, a double-click reset, touch targets
 * sized for coarse pointers and `aria-valuenow` on every separator — all of
 * which the library already does correctly and none of which is worth writing
 * twice, let alone twice per axis.
 *
 * Sizes are committed on `onLayoutChanged`, **not** on `onLayoutChange`. The
 * latter fires per pointer sample; persisting from it would write to
 * `localStorage` sixty times a second and re-render every pane while the user
 * is still dragging. Same rule the sidebar's handle states: the store is the
 * persistence layer, not the animation loop.
 *
 * The floors are *sizes* rather than fractions — see `SPLIT_MIN_WIDTH` and
 * `SPLIT_MIN_HEIGHT` — so a pane stays usable on a laptop window as well as on
 * a display.
 *
 * ## Dropping a session
 *
 * While a session is being dragged out of the sidebar, every pane grows a set
 * of targets: a centre that opens it in that pane, and edges that open it in a
 * new pane on that side. Where you drop is where it lands. Edges the grid has
 * no room for are not offered at all, rather than accepting a drop and doing
 * nothing with it.
 *
 * The overlay mounts only while a session drag is actually in progress
 * (`isSessionDrag`, which is answerable during `dragover` — see
 * `lib/sessionDrag.ts`), so nothing intercepts pointer events the rest of the
 * time.
 *
 * ## Moving a pane
 *
 * With more than one pane open, each caption is a handle: pick a pane up by the
 * bar with its name on it and drop it on another pane. The centre swaps the
 * two; an edge moves it to that side — beside the target in its row, or into a
 * full-width row above or below it. The pane itself travels, not a copy of its
 * conversation, so a run that is streaming keeps streaming through the move.
 * See `movePane`.
 *
 * Same overlay, same rule: it mounts only while a pane is in hand, and never
 * over the pane being carried.
 *
 * ## Nothing here reads the transcript
 *
 * Same rule as the sidebar. This component re-renders when a pane is opened or
 * closed and when a drag starts — never on a token. Each pane owns a
 * `TranscriptModel` subscribed to by its own leaf rows, so a fast run in one
 * pane cannot re-render another.

/**
 * The layout a group should mount with, computed **once per group**.
 *
 * ## Why this is a hook and not a function call in the JSX
 *
 * `defaultLayout` is not an ordinary render prop. The library holds it in the
 * dependency list of the effect that registers the group and applies its
 * layout, so a *new object identity* is indistinguishable from "the author
 * changed the default sizes": the effect re-runs and re-applies the layout.
 * Building it inline meant a fresh object on every render, so every render of
 * the grid re-registered both groups and re-applied their sizes — during the
 * exact renders where the panel set was changing, which is the moment a group
 * is least able to cope with being told to re-lay-out from scratch.
 *
 * Computing it in a state initialiser pins it to the panel set the group
 * actually mounted with, and never recomputes. If panels are added or removed
 * later the library redistributes on its own, which is what it is for — and a
 * `defaultLayout` describing a different number of panels is discarded by the
 * library rather than applied, so the stale value is inert.
 *
 * ## All or nothing
 *
 * A group whose positions are only partly remembered gets `undefined` and
 * splits evenly. `defaultLayout` is a complete description of a group, and half
 * of one — three panes remembered, a fourth just opened and unknown — would
 * settle the grid somewhere nobody chose.

 * header can only name one of them — it names the focused pane — so each gets
 * its own line. The focused one is the brighter, which is what ties the

 *
 * Console's `.main.foc` colours the focused pane's *border* with the accent at
 * 55% and lifts its caption text to full ink; every other pane keeps the
 * hairline. This caption's bottom rule is the only edge a pane draws — the
 * grid separates columns with the wrapper's own border — so that is where the
 * accent lands.
 *
 * `border-beam/55`, up from the `/40` it was, because the rest of the caption
 * got quieter around it: `border-line` became a 7% alpha hairline and
 * `bg-raised` became a 3.5% wash, so an accent held at the old value would now
 * be the loudest thing in a bar that is otherwise barely there. The two moved
 * together on purpose — the mark has to stay legible against a fainter ground,
