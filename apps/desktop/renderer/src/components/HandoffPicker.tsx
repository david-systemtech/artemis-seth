/**
 * The hand-off picker: the informed question a plan limit now opens.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * ADR 0003 in component form. When `handoffTrigger` fires, the run is
 * interrupted and settled exactly as before — and then, instead of silently
 * spending the last of the budget on a continuity note, this dialog asks the
 * one question the machinery cannot answer: *where should this work go?* It
 * says what happened (which window tripped, when it resets), shows every
 * account that could take the conversation with its live facts, and waits.
 * Nothing moves unchosen; declining degrades to the note, exactly as shipped.
 *
 * ## The rows speak the navigator's language
 *
 * A candidate row is the run navigator's profile row re-said in a dialog:
 * swatch, name, tier, signed-out amber, and the binding window's percentage at
 * the trailing edge on `toneFor`'s thresholds — plus one fact the navigator
 * cannot show, because only this surface knows which model the conversation is
 * on: that model's own pressure on the candidate account, through the
 * `modelFacts` join and the navigator's exported `PressureDot`. That is the
 * honest answer to `bindingWindow`'s workload-blindness (§5 obstacle 5):
 * `drain-v1` does not exist yet, so no ranking is offered — the facts are, and
 * the user chooses. A blocked account renders struck through with its reason,
 * never hidden — the `GatedItem` precedent, again.
 *
 * ## Why the store opens it and the component only answers
 *
 * The offer is pane state (`handoffOffer`), written by the trigger flow after
 * the interrupted run has settled — which is what guarantees the promotion of
 * the session id has already happened by the time a choice can land. The
 * component renders the standing question and routes the three answers:
 * choose (`chooseHandoffTarget`), decline to the note
 * (`declineHandoffOffer`), stay (`dismissHandoffOffer` — also Escape, which
 * must never be a trap).
