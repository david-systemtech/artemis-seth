/**
 * The shared-config probe, against a real filesystem.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Every one of these tests builds a sandbox, points `HOME` at it, and looks at
 * what the probe says about it. There is no mocking of `fs` here on purpose: the
 * whole value of this module is that it agrees with the disk, and a test against
 * a fake `lstat` would agree with whatever the test author believed `lstat` does.
 * Symlinks are the subject matter, and symlinks are exactly where a belief about
 * `lstat` goes wrong.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS FILE IMPORTS RENDERER CODE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The first suite runs the *real* generated script and then probes the result.
 * That crosses a boundary main-process source never crosses — `@/lib/…` is
 * renderer code — and it is the single most valuable assertion available here:
 * the pane's reading and the script's writing are two independent
 * implementations of one arrangement, and this is the only place they are made
 * to agree. If the names the script walks and the names {@link SHARED_ENTRIES}
 * lists ever drift, or a link's spelling stops matching what the prober compares
 * against, a share that ran perfectly starts rendering as a gap — and nothing
 * else in the suite would notice.
 *
 * That round trip runs once per shell on the machine, for the reason set out in
 * the generator's own suite: the script reaches the user through a Copy button,
 * so the shell that runs it is whichever one they had open, and it has already
 * behaved differently in one of them.
 *
 * On Windows the round trip runs against the PowerShell script instead, and it
 * is worth more there than anywhere else. The arrangement is made out of
 * junctions and a hard link, the prober answers for them with two different
 * questions — `readlink`, and a `dev`/`ino` comparison — and neither question is
 * asked at all on the other platforms. A drift between the script and the reader
 * would be invisible in every other suite in the repository.
