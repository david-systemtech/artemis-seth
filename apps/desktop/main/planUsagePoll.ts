/**
 * Keeping every account's plan usage current, so the profile menu can advise.
 *
 * The status bar's meter reads the *active* profile, on demand, when its
 * popover opens. That answers "how much room have I got left here" and cannot
 * answer the question this file exists for — "which of my accounts should I be
 * running in right now" — because nothing had ever read the others. This walks
 * all of them on a timer and pushes what it finds, which is what turns a set of
 * per-profile gauges into a comparison.
 *
 * ## Why the poll lives in main
 *
 * Each reading spawns the provider's CLI. A renderer-side timer would spawn one
 * subprocess per profile *per window*, so opening a second Artemis window would
 * double the machine's load to compute the same numbers, and the numbers would
 * disagree between windows while the reads raced. One poller here, one cache
 * (the engine's), fanned out to whoever is open.
 *
 * ## What it is careful about
 *
 * A cycle is **serial**. Six accounts polled in parallel is six CLIs starting
 * at once, every five minutes, forever — the profiles screen already learned
 * this and queues its own reads for the same reason. Chained, the whole cycle
 * costs a few seconds of wall clock that nobody is waiting on.
 *
 * A cycle **cannot overlap its successor**: the next one is scheduled when the
 * last finishes, not on a fixed interval, so a machine where the CLI takes
 * thirty seconds per account does not accumulate cycles until it falls over.
 *
 * A cycle is **skipped while no window is open**. On macOS closing the last
 * window leaves the app running, and readings collected then can be observed by
 * nobody — they would be stale again by the time a window opened.
 *
 * ## Two cadences, one timer
 *
 * The full sweep walks every profile, and that is what costs: one CLI per
 * account. Between sweeps, a faster tick reads only the profiles that have a
 * run on them — the only accounts whose numbers can move on their own, and the
 * ones automatic handoff is deciding about. On an idle machine that tick reads
 * nothing at all, so the faster cadence costs nothing until there is work to
 * measure.
 *
 * One timer running at the fast cadence, deciding at each tick which kind of
 * cycle is due, rather than two timers. Two would eventually fire together and
 * start the same account's CLI twice.
 *
 * A failure is **per profile**. One account whose CLI is missing, wedged or
 * signed out must not stop the accounts behind it in the queue from being read,
 * which is exactly when the recommendation matters most.
