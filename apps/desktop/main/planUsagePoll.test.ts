/**
 * Two cadences, and the cost model that justifies the faster one.
 *
 * Automatic handoff decides when to stop from these readings, so the poll was
 * tightened from five minutes to two. On its own that would be a straight
 * multiplication of the thing the poller's header is most careful about: a
 * reading spawns the provider's CLI, once per profile, so a machine with eight
 * accounts would go from eight subprocesses every five minutes to eight every
 * two.
 *
 * It does not, because the fast tick between sweeps reads only the profiles
 * that have a run on them. Those are the only accounts whose numbers can move
 * without anyone touching the app, and they are the ones a handoff is about. So
 * the assertions here are mostly about what is *not* read: an idle machine must
 * cost nothing extra, and a busy one must pay for the accounts doing work
 * rather than for every account configured.
