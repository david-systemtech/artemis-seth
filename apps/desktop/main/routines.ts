/**
 * Routines — the app keeps its own appointments.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The host that owns `routines.json`, the minute scheduler, and the history of
 * what fired. Modelled on `server.ts`, its next-door neighbour: same data
 * directory, same atomic write, same tolerant reader, same broadcast-on-change
 * contract with the renderer.
 *
 * ## A firing is an ordinary run
 *
 * Each due minute starts a fresh run through the ordinary engine —
 * `engine.startRun` with the routine's prompt, directory, profile and model —
 * so a routine's work gets everything a typed turn gets for free: a real
 * transcript, session history, the prompt library, ownership attribution. The
 * one difference is a `routineId` stamped into `RunInput.metadata`, which is
 * how firings are found again: the overlap guard reads it off `listRuns`, and
 * the history ledger records what each one became.
 *
 * ## The scheduler runs with no window open
 *
 * Unlike `planUsagePoll`, which skips cycles when nobody is looking, this is
 * the first main-process timer that does real work unwatched — that is the
 * point of a schedule. On macOS the app outlives its windows, and a routine
 * due at 09:00 fires at 09:00 whether or not a window exists to watch it.
 *
 * ## Sleep, and the one catch-up
 *
 * Timers do not fire while the machine sleeps; they fire late, on wake. The
 * tick notices the gap (a minute tick that arrives minutes late is a machine
 * that was asleep, not a timer that drifted) and runs the catch-up rule: for
 * each routine, the *newest* appointment missed during the gap — within seven
 * days — fires once, and older misses are let go. A laptop opened Monday does
 * not replay the weekend.
 *
 * ## Deliberately not Electron-aware
 *
 * Notifications and power events arrive through injected options rather than
 * `electron` imports, for the same reason `server.ts` has none: this file is
 * exercised by vitest in a plain Node environment, and the desktop wiring in
 * `index.ts` is one line per hook.
