/**
 * Outbound leak detection.
 *
 * The single most important invariant in Artemis is that **a secret never crosses
 * the IPC boundary into the renderer**. The profile handlers are written to
 * return {@link import('@rx-artemis/protocol').ProfileMetadata}, never `Profile` —
 * but "written to" is a property of today's code, not of tomorrow's refactor.
 * This module is the tripwire that makes the invariant hold mechanically.
 *
 * Two independent checks run over every payload on its way out:
 *
 *  1. **Structural.** Certain *key names* must never appear in anything the
 *     renderer receives. `publicEnv` is what distinguishes `Profile` from
 *     `ProfileMetadata`, so its presence means someone returned the wrong
 *     shape. `secretRef`, `apiKey` and friends mean someone returned a
 *     credential outright — Artemis has none to return any more, which makes
 *     their appearance a regression rather than a mistake. This check is cheap
 *     and it catches the realistic bug.
 *
 *  2. **Value shape.** Every string is matched against a set of credential
 *     patterns — `sk-…`, `sk-ant-…`, AWS access key ids, PEM private key
 *     headers, `Bearer …`. This catches a credential that arrived somewhere
 *     unexpected, e.g. embedded in a provider error message.
 *
 * A hit throws {@link SecretLeakError}. Failing closed is deliberate: a broken
 * feature is recoverable, a leaked key is not.
 *
 * ### Why some fields are exempt
 *
 * Not every string is ours to police. Model output, tool results and user
 * prompts are *content*: if a user pastes their own key into a prompt, the
 * transcript legitimately contains it, and refusing to render the conversation
 * would be both useless and confusing. Those fields are listed in
 * {@link ScanPolicy.contentKeys} (scanned structurally, exempt from the value
 * patterns) and {@link ScanPolicy.opaqueKeys} (not descended into at all,
 * because a tool result can be megabytes of arbitrary JSON).
 *
 * The distinction is what makes the check usable: everything Artemis itself
 * assembles is scanned strictly, and only provider/user content is exempt.
 *
 * ### Which policy a payload gets
 *
 * The exemptions above are worth nothing if the payload is handed the wrong
 * policy, and *which* policy is a property of the channel, not of the
 * direction. A pushed `AgentEvent` and a replayed one are the same bytes; so
 * are a terminal's live output and its replay buffer. {@link assertResponseSafe}
 * is where that mapping lives, so every `ipcMain.handle` response goes through
 * one decision rather than one default.

 * entropy heuristic would flag base64 tool output constantly, and a check that
 * cries wolf gets deleted. These are the shapes that actually appear in a
 * credential Artemis could plausibly hold.
 *
 * The `sk-` rule is the one named in Artemis's security brief; the rest are
 * defence in depth for the Bedrock / Vertex / Foundry backends.
 *
 * ## `sk-` has to *start* something
 *
 * Both `sk-` rules open on a word boundary, and that is a fix rather than
 * tidiness. Without it the rule matched inside ordinary words: `task-`, `disk-`,
 * `risk-` and `mask-` all end in `sk-`, and a kebab-case name runs on for well
 * over twenty key-legal characters. A memory called
 * `gamingpc-hidden-task-needs-conhost-headless` read as a credential —
 * `sk-needs-conhost-headless` — and because a memory bank's index rides along
 * on the prompt library's response, one slug in a team's bank refused the whole
 * Instructions pane with a credential-safety error about nothing. The same
 * pattern scrubs log lines, so it was also redacting file names out of them.
 *
 * A real key is never the tail of a longer word: it follows a quote, an equals
 * sign, a colon, a space, a slash or the start of the string, and every one of
 * those is a boundary. What this gives up is a key glued to a preceding letter,
 * digit or underscore, which is not a shape any provider issues or any config
 * format writes.
