/**
 * Give the bundle's one shipped executable its executable bit.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * node-pty's `spawn-helper`, and nothing else. The banks' CLI used to be the
 * second case here — an extension-less Python script whose shebang is
 * decoration without an execute bit — but Artemis ships no copy of it any
 * more: a bank that needs one carries its own, in a git checkout whose modes
 * are the user's. See `main/memoryBanks.ts`.
 *
 * On macOS and Linux node-pty spawns a shell by exec'ing a small helper binary
 * that sets up the controlling terminal first. The published node-pty tarball
 * ships that helper as `0644` — no execute bit for anyone — and every step
 * between npm and a user's machine faithfully preserves it: `asarUnpack`
 * extracts it into `app.asar.unpacked` with the mode it had, the dmg and the
 * zip carry the mode through, and the install arrives unable to exec the one
 * file it must. The failure is `posix_spawnp failed`, raised at the moment
 * somebody opens a terminal and naming neither the file nor the permission.
 *
 * Setting the bit here — after the app directory is packed, before it is signed
 * and long before it is compressed — is what makes it true for everyone who
 * installs the result.
 *
 * ## Why the app cannot do this to itself
 *
 * It tries, and should: `main/terminal.ts` chmods the helper on first use, and
 * that is what repairs a checkout. But an app cannot chmod a file it does not
 * own, and a released one frequently does not own itself — installed into
 * `/Applications` by an admin and run by a standard user, deployed read-only by
 * MDM, or simply run off the mounted dmg without being copied out at all. In
 * every one of those the runtime repair fails and the terminal stays broken.
 * Package time is the last moment the file is reliably writable.
 *
 * `chmod` does not invalidate a code signature — a signature covers contents,
 * not inode mode — and electron-builder runs this hook before signing anyway.
 *
 * ## Why it throws
 *
 * A hook that shrugs when it finds nothing is how the previous version of this
 * fix failed: it repaired the wrong path, said nothing about it, and shipped.
 * On a platform that needs a helper, finding none means node-pty moved it, or
 * `asarUnpack` stopped covering node-pty, or the resources directory is not
 * where it was — each of which ships a build whose terminal cannot start. That
 * is worth failing a release over, and the release workflow re-checks the
 * finished bundle in `scripts/verify-package.ts` in case this is ever skipped.
