/**
 * Codex ⇄ Artemis translation, as pure functions.
 *
 * The counterpart to `mapper.ts`, and written to the same rule: everything here
 * is deterministic and free of I/O — no subprocess, no socket, no clock except
 * the injected one. `codex.ts` is the plumbing; this file is the meaning.
 *
 * ## What the mapping has to guarantee
 *
 * The rules on protocol's `AgentEvent` are a contract, not advice:
 *
 *  1. `session.started` first, `run.end` last, exactly once each, nothing after
 *     `run.end`.
 *  2. `seq` is dense and monotonic from 0. Every event is stamped through
 *     {@link stamp}, including the ones the adapter emits out of band — a
 *     permission prompt arrives as a JSON-RPC *request*, not as a notification,
 *     so it never passes through {@link mapCodexNotification} at all. That is
 *     why the counter lives on {@link CodexMapperState}.
 *  3. Deltas are additive and never re-sent. `text.complete` still carries the
 *     whole block, so a consumer that ignores deltas renders correctly.
 *  4. Every `tool.start` gets a `tool.end` — including on interrupt, where
 *     {@link flushCodexToolCalls} closes the stragglers as `cancelled`.
 *
 * ## Items, not messages
 *
 * Codex models a turn as a list of *items* with `item/started` and
 * `item/completed` bracketing each one, rather than as a stream of messages.
 * That is a better fit for Artemis than it first appears: `tool.start`/`tool.end`
 * fall straight out of the bracket, and an item id is a natural `toolCallId`.
 * The mismatch is on the text side, where Codex brackets an `agentMessage` item
 * whose deltas arrive in between — so `item/started` for text emits nothing and
 * `item/completed` carries the whole block.
 *
 * ## Dropped notifications
 *
 * The protocol has 69 notification variants; Artemis acts on 10. The rest are
 * host-CLI presentation state (MCP startup progress, hook lifecycle, remote
 * control status, realtime audio) with no place in a normalized transcript.
 * Every one is dropped **explicitly** in {@link mapCodexNotification}'s switch,
 * never by falling through a `default` nobody thought about, and no unknown
 * notification throws.

 * Turn a usage report into a `delta`-scoped event.
 *
 * ## Why `delta` and not `cumulative`
 *
 * `thread/tokenUsage/updated` carries two breakdowns: `total` for the whole
 * *thread* and `last` for the most recent model request. Measured against the
 * real app server, a turn containing two shell commands produced three usage
 * notifications — one per model request — whose `last` values summed exactly to
 * the final `total` (13563 + 13673 + 13724 = 40960).
 *
 * So `last` is a true delta, and `total` is thread-scoped rather than
 * run-scoped. That distinction is the whole argument: a run is one turn, but a
 * *thread* outlives it, so on a resumed session `total` opens at whatever the
 * previous turns spent. Reporting it as this run's cumulative usage would show
 * the user a number that starts high and belongs to work they already paid for.
 * Summing `last` is correct for a fresh thread and a resumed one alike.
 *
 * `contextTokens` comes from `last.totalTokens` rather than the running total,
 * because it answers a different question — how full the window is right now,
 * not how much has been billed.
 *
 * ## Only the live turn's reports count
 *
 * A resumed thread replays its most recent turn's usage right after the
 * `thread/resume` response, before this run's turn begins — tokens the run
 * that spent them already reported. The replay names the turn it belongs to,
 * so a report for a turn this run is not running is someone else's bill and
 * is dropped rather than summed.
