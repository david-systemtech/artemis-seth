/**
 * Reading another Artemis's model catalogue.
 *
 * `GET /api/v0/models` answers with `ServerModelsBody`: every route the
 * connection may use, across every profile the serving Artemis holds. The
 * mapping that matters is `route` → {@link ProviderModelOption.id} — the route
 * (`work-max/opus`) is what `POST /v1/chat/completions` takes as `model`, so
 * carrying it as the option id means the picker's choice is already the wire
 * value and nothing above the adapter has to know routes exist.
 *
 * Validated leniently, like the local catalogue parsers: this reads a body
 * from a server that may be a newer or older build than this one, and a row it
 * cannot read is dropped rather than failing the list.
