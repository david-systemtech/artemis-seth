/**
 * Claude ⇄ Artemis translation, as pure functions.
 *
 * Everything in this file is deterministic and free of I/O: no process is
 * spawned, no clock is read (the clock is injected), no SDK function is called.
 * It imports the Agent SDK for **types only**, so importing this module does
 * not even load `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`. That is deliberate — the
 * mapping is the part of the adapter most likely to be wrong and most worth
 * testing, so it must be testable without a subprocess.
 *
 * `./claude.ts` is the plumbing (the SDK query, the input pump, permission
 * deferreds, disposal). This file is the meaning.
 *
 * ## What the mapping has to guarantee
 *
 * The rules on protocol's `AgentEvent` are a contract, not advice:
 *
 *  1. `session.started` first, `run.end` last, exactly once each, nothing after
 *     `run.end`.
 *  2. `seq` is dense and monotonic from 0. Every event is stamped through
 *     {@link stamp}, including events the adapter emits out of band (permission
 *     prompts arrive from `canUseTool`, not from the message stream), which is
 *     why the counter lives on {@link ClaudeMapperState} rather than inside a
 *     closure here.
 *  3. Deltas are additive and never re-sent. `text.complete` still carries the
 *     whole block, so a consumer that ignores deltas renders correctly.
 *  4. Every `tool.start` gets a `tool.end` — including on interrupt, where
 *     {@link flushOpenToolCalls} closes the stragglers as `cancelled` before
 *     `run.end`.
 *
 * ## Dropped messages
 *
 * The SDK emits ~38 message variants; the protocol union has 9 events. Most of
 * the difference is host-CLI presentation state (status spinners, hook
 * progress, task bookkeeping, notifications) with no place in a normalized
 * transcript. Every one of those is dropped **explicitly**, with a comment
 * saying why, in {@link mapSdkMessage}'s switch. Nothing is dropped by falling
 * through a `default` that nobody thought about, and no unrecognised message
 * ever throws.

 * reader has not seen. That is true, and it is still the wrong conclusion: the
 * transcript's user rows are a record of what a person said, and filling them
 * with instructions the harness wrote puts words in someone's mouth. A skill's
 * several hundred lines of design guidance appearing as though it had been
 * typed is the case that made this obvious.
 *
 * Nothing is lost by dropping them, which is the other half of the argument.
 * The `Skill` call that pulled the text in is already a tool row; a
 * continuation is visible as the run continuing; a system reminder is
 * addressed to the model and is not about the conversation at all. What the
 * reader would gain is noise attributed to them.
 *
 * Replayed history is the case that stays: it is the same person's earlier
 * turns, read back off disk, and it is checked for synthesis too so that a
 * replayed injection does not sneak in the way a live one did.
 *
 * The synthesis flag is not the whole story, though. The harness also writes
 * turns it does not consider synthetic — a task notification about background
 * work is the one that matters, `origin: { kind: 'task-notification' }` and
 * nothing else marking it — and those replay with the flag unset. So when a
 * message declares its own authorship, that declaration is believed outright:
