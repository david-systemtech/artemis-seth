/**
 * Asking the user something, in both directions.
 *
 * Claude's `AskUserQuestion` parks a run on the permission callback the same
 * way an approval does, so these two functions are the whole difference between
 * a card that shows a person a JSON blob and one that shows them a question:
 * `readQuestionPrompt` decodes what was asked, `withQuestionAnswers` encodes
 * what they said.
 *
 * The encoding is the fiddly half, and it is fiddly because the provider's
 * shape is particular: answers keyed by question text, multi-select joined into
 * one string, prose in `annotations` rather than in the answer, and a sentinel
 * for "typed something, chose nothing". Get any of it wrong and the failure is
 * silent — the model is told the user picked an option they did not pick, or
 * that they answered nothing at all.
