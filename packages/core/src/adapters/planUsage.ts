 * sampled. The cost is one subprocess spawn.
 *
 * **The underlying API is explicitly unstable.** At the time of writing the
 * SDK names the method:
 *
 *     usage_EXPERIMENTAL_MAY_CHANGE_DO_NOT_RELY_ON_THIS_API_YET()
 *
 * with a docstring saying it may change or be removed in any release without
 * notice, and that the name *will* change once it stabilises. Calling that
 * directly from anywhere else in Artemis would put a status-line widget on a

 * tolerant lookup here, in one file, and a rename degrades to "unavailable"
 * instead of throwing. When it stabilises, this list is the only thing to edit.
