/**
 * The push feed: one sequenced stream of everything the server pushes.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The desktop delivers pushes with `webContents.send`, which needs no ordering
 * and no memory — a window is either there to hear an event or it is not. An
 * HTTP client is different in exactly two ways, and this module exists for
 * both: the connection *drops* (a sleeping laptop, a switched Wi-Fi network,
 * a proxy timeout), and the client that comes back needs to know what it
 * missed. So every published event takes a **sequence number** from one
 * process-wide counter, a bounded tail is **retained** for replay, and a
 * replay that reaches past the tail says so instead of quietly starting late —
 * the same honesty contract `RunRegistry.eventsSince` keeps for a reloaded
 * window, applied to the wire.
 *
 * The feed knows nothing about HTTP, connections or tokens. It carries an
 * optional {@link FeedScope} per event — which account the event concerns,
 * which workspace pin it belongs to — and the route layer decides what each
 * authenticated connection may hear. Publishing is fire-and-forget and cheap:
 * one array push and a fan-out, on the same hot path as the registry's own
 * event pump, so nothing here may block or throw.

 * know: agent events carry the run's profile, terminal events the workspace
 * pin of the connection family that opened the shell.
