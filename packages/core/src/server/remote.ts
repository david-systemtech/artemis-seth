/**
 * The remote bridge surface: another Artemis, driving this one (ADR 0004).
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * These routes exist so the desktop's `remote` bridge mode can speak its
 * ordinary `IpcRequestMap` vocabulary at a machine it is not running on: the
 * run list is `runs:list`, the per-run replay is `runs:events`, and the event
 * stream is `IPC_PUSH` with a sequence number. Nothing here invents a second
 * vocabulary — the bodies are the protocol package's own shapes, defined in
 * `protocol/remote.ts` so the two ends cannot drift.
 *
 * ## Who may see what
 *
 * Every route is scoped by the *connection's allowance*, exactly as the
 * catalogue is: a run is visible when `connectionAllowsProfile` admits the
 * account it bills, and an invisible run is indistinguishable from an absent
 * one — one 404 for "not there" and "not yours", the same rule the session
 * routes state. The stored-session privacy rule is untouched: live runs are
 * a different surface from stored history, and observing what this machine is
 * *doing* is the feature, while reading what it once *said* stays gated by
 * the ledger's pin.
 *
 * ## The event stream
 *
 * `GET /api/v0/events` is Server-Sent Events over the push feed. It opens
 * with a hello naming the feed's head, replays from `Last-Event-ID` when the
 * client presents one, reports an honest gap when retention has dropped what
 * was asked for, and then follows the live feed with a heartbeat comment
 * often enough that proxies keep the socket and the client can tell quiet
 * from dead. Reconnecting with replay-from is what lets a briefly-dropped
 * client resume without a full re-sync — and what keeps the server's
 * deliberate interrupt-on-disconnect from firing on a network blip rather
 * than a departure.

 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Every sibling route filters by `connectionAllowsProfile`, because it answers

 * *sessions*, and a session id carries no account — so the allowance is not a
 * filter that can be applied to it at all. The first version of this route
 * therefore filtered by nothing, and handed any token, however narrowly scoped,
 * every live session id on the machine plus every delegated task's
 * `description` — which is provider-authored content about work the token had
 * no part in.
 *
 * The right authority is the ledger, which is the single arbiter of "may this
 * connection touch this session" for list, replay and resume alike. Asking it
 * here makes this route agree with `/api/v0/sessions` rather than inventing a
 * fourth rule, and it means the serving desktop's own conversations are absent
 * for the same reason they are absent from the session list: they were never
 * recorded against a connection.
 *
 * A build with no ledger cannot answer the question, so it answers *empty*
 * rather than everything. Empty is contractually safe here in a way it is not
 * everywhere: `RunsLiveWorkResponse` is a set of conversations known to be
 * working — "keep these", never "the rest are finished" — so an under-complete
 * answer costs a client nothing it can act on, while an over-complete one is

   * The resume gate, and it must come before anything that *uses* the session

   *
   * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   * WHY A SESSION ID IS A CAPABILITY, NOT A PARAMETER
   * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   *
   * `resumeSessionId` names a stored conversation, and the provider's store
   * holds every conversation on the machine — the serving user's own local
   * history included. Nothing downstream of here checks ownership:
   * `RunRegistry.start` has no notion of one, so it honours the id and the
   * provider re-opens the transcript.
   *
   * That alone would be a read of somebody else's conversation. What makes it
   * worse is what happens *next*: the run announces its session id, the guard
   * hears it, and the host records it into the ledger against this connection.
   * The ledger is keyed on session id and the last writer wins, so the entry
   * that said "this belongs to the desktop user" is overwritten to say "this
   * belongs to the caller's token" — and `mayAccess` starts returning true.
   * The private transcript then becomes durably readable through
   * `/api/v0/sessions/{id}/messages`, by the ordinary route, forever. A
   * borrowed id would have laundered itself into an owned one.
   *
   * So the id is checked against the same ledger scope the sibling completions
   * surface checks, with the same refusal the session routes give: "not yours"
   * and "not there" are one answer, because a caller that could tell them
   * apart could enumerate which conversations exist on the machine.
   *
   * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   * WHY THIS IS ALSO BEFORE `resolvePinnedCwd`
   * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   *
   * Not merely tidy ordering. `resolvePinnedCwd` passes the session id to the
   * workspace resolver, whose scratch map is keyed on session id alone with no
   * connection scoping — so naming another connection's session would resolve
   * this run *into that connection's scratch directory*. Refusing first is
   * what keeps a foreign id from reaching it at all.
   *
   * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   * WHY NO LEDGER MEANS REFUSE
   * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   *
   * The completions surface skips this check when there is no ledger, which is
   * defensible there: that surface cannot start a conversation it could later
   * be asked to re-enter, so there is nothing to own. This route can. A build
   * with no ledger has no way to establish that a session belongs to anybody,
   * and "cannot prove it is yours" has to read as no — the alternative is a
   * deployment where every stored conversation on the machine is resumable by
   * any token, reached by dropping one optional dependency.

 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THE PATH IS RESOLVED BEFORE IT IS COMPARED
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A prefix test on the raw string is not containment, and the counterexample is
 * one line long: `/w/../../etc` starts with `/w/` and names `/etc`. Every
 * dot-segment spelling has to be collapsed *before* the comparison, which is
 * exactly what `path.resolve` does — it is the same reasoning the renderer's
 * `file:` navigation check states, where the raw URL is discarded in favour of
 * the parser's serialized `href` for this precise reason.
 *
 * The boundary test is then `===` or a prefix ending in the path separator, so
 * that `/workspace-2` is not admitted by a `/workspace` pin. A trailing slash
 * on the pin would produce the same result; comparing against a resolved root
 * makes it true regardless of how the pin was typed.
 *
 * **What this does not do is resolve symlinks.** A symlink inside the pin that
 * points outside it still leads outside, and `realpath` is the only thing that
 * would catch it — at the cost of an async stat per path and a refusal for any
 * directory that does not yet exist. Artemis's local boundary
 * (`requireAbsolutePath`) is lexical for the same reasons, so this matches the
 * posture rather than inventing a second one; and the pin is a *rooting* rule
 * rather than a sandbox in any case — a shell or an agent inside it can `cd`
 * anywhere the serving user can. What the pin governs is where work is rooted
 * and what a token may *declare* it reaches, and that is what this enforces.

 *
 *  - a `directory` pin admits the directory and anything beneath it, which is
 *    what lets a remote window work in a repo's subfolder or a worktree
 *    inside it;
 *  - an `ephemeral` pin resolves to the connection's scratch space and the
 *    caller's `cwd` is ignored entirely — it names a path on the wrong
 *    machine, and scratch is minted here;
 *  - `none` cannot run turns at all.
 *
