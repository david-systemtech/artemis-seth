/**
 * The local server, as the main process consumes it.
 *
 * Three pieces and one seam: {@link createCatalogue} turns the engine's three
 * questions into the catalogue other programs read, and
 * {@link createArtemisServer} puts it on a port. Neither knows anything about
 * Electron — the engine reaches this through {@link CatalogueSource}, which is
 * the wall `packages/core` keeps everywhere else too.
 *
 * `workspaces.ts` is the third: a connection names where its turns run, and that
 * has to become a real directory on this disk — created and reaped when it is
 * scratch space, checked when it is the user's own folder.
 *
 * `runs.ts` is the fourth, and it is the one that only exists because clients
 * are remote: it remembers which connection owns which completions-started
 * run, so a run can be addressed after the request that started it is over,
 * and it holds the two deadlines that keep "addressable later" from meaning
 * "alive forever". The remote bridge's own runs are governed by `guard.ts`
 * instead, and no run is ever in both.
 *
 * `signin.ts` is the fifth, and it exists because a server has no terminal. A
 * profile is worth serving once an account is signed into it, and in a
 * container there is nobody inside to run the login — so the login runs *here*,
 * driven by a person on a client somewhere else. It carries a verification URL
 * out and a pasted code in, and no credential either way.
