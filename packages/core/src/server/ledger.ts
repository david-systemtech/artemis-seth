/**
 * Which server conversation belongs to which connection.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * A turn that arrives over the HTTP server writes a real session under a real
 * account — resumable, auditable, billed like any other. Two different
 * consumers need to know *which* sessions those are, and they need different
 * halves of the same fact:
 *
 *  - The desktop sidebar needs "was this started by a program?", so it can
 *    keep a polling client from burying the person's own history. That was
 *    the whole of the original ledger (`serverSessions.ts` in the desktop
 *    app), and `has()` still answers it.
 *
 *  - The server's own session surface needs "*whose* is it?" — because a
 *    connection token is an identity, and one identity must not be able to
 *    list, read, or resume another's conversations. That is the half this
 *    file adds, and the reason the record grew an owner.
 *
 * ## The scope rule
 *
 * A connection's identity is its **pin**: the profile its turns bill and the
 * workspace they run in, both fixed when the token was created. Two tokens
 * with the same pin are the same principal — the same account writing to the
 * same store in the same directory — and they see each other's sessions,
 * which is precisely what lets one person's laptops share one history.
 * Different pins are different principals and see nothing of each other.
 *
 * The rule is enforced on every surface that takes a session id: listing,
 * replaying, and resuming. Resuming matters most — the session store under a
 * profile's config directory also holds every conversation the *desktop
 * user* ever had in that directory, and a token that could resume one would
 * be reading a private transcript through the model's context. A session is
 * reachable over HTTP only if this ledger says a same-pin connection created
 * it; the desktop user's own sessions are never recorded here, so they are
 * structurally unreachable, not merely refused.
 *
 * ## Durability, honestly stated
 *
 * The file is written lazily and capped. Losing an entry means a server
 * conversation stops being listable over HTTP and reappears in the desktop
 * sidebar — a cosmetic regression, not an access-control failure, because
 * access is granted by presence and absence only ever narrows. The cap drops
 * oldest first for the same reason the original ledger did: a machine left
 * polling accumulates one entry per conversation forever, and this file is
 * read at startup.
