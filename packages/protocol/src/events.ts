/**
 * The normalized event union.
 *
 * This is the narrow waist of the whole application. Every provider maps its
 * native stream onto exactly these nine event types, and every consumer — the
 * session store, the transcript renderer, the usage readout — reads only
 * these. If something cannot be expressed here, it does not reach the UI.
 *
 * Rules for adapter authors:
 *
 *  1. **Order is the contract.** `session.started` is always first. `run.end`
 *     is always last and always emitted, including on failure and on dispose.
 *     Nothing follows `run.end`.
 *  2. **`seq` is dense and monotonic** within a run, starting at 0. Consumers
 *     use it to detect drops and to sort after an IPC round-trip.
 *  3. **Deltas are additive.** Concatenating every `text.delta` for a
 *     `(messageId, blockIndex)` pair must reproduce the `text` of the matching
 *     `text.complete`. Never re-send text already sent as a delta.
 *  4. **Non-streaming providers skip the deltas.** If
 *     {@link import('./provider.js').Capabilities.partialMessages} is false,
 *     emit `text.complete` only. A provider that cannot stream *thinking*
 *     separately should emit one `thinking.delta` carrying the whole block
 *     rather than inventing a completion event.
 *  5. **Every `tool.start` gets a `tool.end`.** Including when the run is
 *     interrupted — emit `tool.end` with `status: 'cancelled'` before
 *     `run.end`. The UI must never be left with a spinner it cannot clear.

 * ## Why the stream has to say so

 * Answering a prompt is an IPC *call*, and a call is invisible to anyone who was

 * the caller — it is what a second window reads, and what a reloaded renderer
 * replays. Without this event that account is missing its second half: every
 * `permission.request` in the history reads as still open, forever.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. `⌘R` reloads the renderer without touching the main
 * process, and the re-attach path replays the retained events through the
 * ordinary handlers. A request whose answer was never written down came back
 * *pending* — so the user was asked to approve something they had already
 * approved, and answering the ghost failed, because the registry had long since
 * settled it. Emitting the resolution is what makes the replay agree with the
 * run.
 *
 * ## Emitted for every way a request can end
 *
 * The user answering is only one of them. The provider can withdraw a request
 * (the turn was interrupted, the tool became moot) and adapters settle
 * everything outstanding on dispose. Those paths never reach
 * `respondToPermission`, so a consumer that inferred resolution from its own
 * calls would keep waiting on them — which is the bug one level up from the one
 * above. Adapters emit this for all three.
 *
 * Always follows the matching `permission.request`, and never appears without
 * one. Consumers key on {@link requestId} and must tolerate an id they do not
 * know: the retained history is bounded, so a long run can drop the request and
 * keep the resolution.

 * rows in it is the authoritative "nothing is running any more" rather than an
 * absence of news. That shape is chosen for failure-resistance: a consumer that
 * pairs start and finish edges wedges a stale spinner the moment it misses one,
 * and a consumer that swaps its set cannot.
 *
 * That property is what makes this event load-bearing rather than decorative:
 * it is how the main process knows whether a provider process still has work in
 * it, which decides whether the process may be closed when a turn ends. Before
 * this existed the answer was assumed to be "no" and background work was killed
 * at every turn boundary.
 *
 * ## Settled rows are in here too, and are bounded
 *
 * A row does not vanish when its task finishes, because the moment it settles is
 * the moment its result is worth reading — what it cost, what it said, where it
 * wrote its output. It stays, marked, and the oldest settled rows are dropped
 * once there are more than a handful: worth keeping for the one the reader is
 * looking at, not for the ninety before it. Liveness is
 * {@link isTaskLive}, never "is it still in the array".
 *
 * ## The set is per provider process, and starts empty
 *
 * The SDK emits nothing at startup, so a consumer must reset to empty whenever
 * the provider process restarts rather than carrying rows across. In Artemis
 * that is the adapter's job — see the task ledger — and it matters because a row
 * carried across a restart is a claim about work in a process that no longer
 * exists.

/**
 * A message the user sent into a running turn has been taken up by the provider.
 *
 * Not a transcript row — the row was drawn optimistically the moment the words
 * were typed, and this says nothing new about what they were. What it carries
 * is *timing*: a message sent mid-turn is queued until the provider reaches a
 * point where it can read it, and until this arrives the only honest thing a
 * UI can say about it is "waiting".
 *
 * The gap this closes is a real one. A mid-run message is folded into the
 * running turn at a tool boundary, and that fold used to be invisible from
 * outside the provider process: the CLI echoes the message back on its own
 * stream, the Claude mapper drops the echo (correctly — a second row would show
 * the user their own words twice), and nothing downstream ever learned the
 * message had been read. A queued indicator built on the send alone therefore
 * had nothing to clear it but the end of the run, and went on claiming a
 * message was unread while the agent was visibly acting on it.
 *
 * `messageId` is the identity Artemis filed the message under — the same
 * `${runId}:prompt:${n}` the retained prompt carries, and the same one a window
 * claims optimistically when it draws the row. Not the provider's own id: the
 * adapter is handed this one when the message is sent and translates back
 * before emitting, so a consumer can match this against the row already on
 * screen without knowing anything about provider id spaces.
 *
 * Emitted at most once per message, and only for messages the provider actually
 * queued. A message a provider takes immediately never needs one: `send` has
 * already answered `deliveredImmediately`.
