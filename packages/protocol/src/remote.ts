/**
 * The remote bridge surface: what a driving Artemis and a serving Artemis
 * agree on.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * ADR 0004 makes remote control a *bridge mode*: the renderer's existing UI
 * speaks its ordinary `IpcRequestMap` vocabulary, and a thin client maps each
 * call onto the HTTP routes named here. Nothing in this file invents a second
 * vocabulary — every body carries the same `RunHandle`s, `AgentEvent`s and
 * `TerminalInfo`s the desktop already renders, because the whole point of the
 * design is that the remote machine is drawn by the same code that draws the
 * local one.
 *
 * Two kinds of thing live here:
 *
 *  1. **Routes and bodies** for the observe/control surface, all under the
 *     native `/api/v0` prefix beside the session routes. Requests carry ids in
 *     the path and JSON in the body; the token travels in the `Authorization`
 *     header and never in a URL, where it would land in every proxy and access
 *     log between the two machines.
 *
 *  2. **The event stream's framing.** `GET /api/v0/events` is Server-Sent
 *     Events carrying `IpcPushMap` payloads — the exact objects
 *     `webContents.send` would have carried — one SSE message per push, the
 *     push channel's own name in the `event:` field and the feed's sequence
 *     number in `id:`. A client reconnecting sends the last id it applied
 *     (the standard `Last-Event-ID` header) and is replayed what it missed;
 *     when the server's retention has already dropped some of that, the first
 *     message is an explicit {@link RemoteGapPayload} rather than a silently
 *     shortened history — the same honesty rule `RunsEventsResponse.truncated`
 *     states for the in-process replay buffer.
