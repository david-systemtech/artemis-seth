/**
 * Routines — work the app does on a schedule, without being asked twice.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * A routine is a saved prompt with an appointment: instructions, a directory,
 * a profile to bill, and a schedule. When the schedule comes due, the main
 * process starts an ordinary run through the ordinary engine — same
 * transcripts, same history, same review surfaces as a turn the user typed —
 * tagged with the routine's id so its firings can be found again.
 *
 * This module is the *vocabulary*: the record, the schedule shapes, and the
 * pure minute-matching math. It deliberately contains no timer and no I/O —
 * the scheduler lives in the main process, and the renderer uses the same
 * functions here to show "next fires at" without asking anyone.
 *
 * ## Time is local, and minutes are the resolution
 *
 * Schedules are written in the machine's local time ("09:00 means my 09:00"),
 * which is what every desktop scheduler people already trust does. The floor
 * is one minute: the scheduler ticks on minute boundaries, and a schedule
 * cannot name anything finer.
