 * Because each profile gets its own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, and Claude stores
 * transcripts under `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<id>.jsonl`,
 * isolating a profile's credentials also isolates its history — for free.
 * Sessions are therefore partitioned by (profile × project), and both
 * coordinates are recoverable without any bookkeeping of Artemis's own: the
 * profile is *which* config directory a session was found in, and the project
 * is the {@link SessionSummary.cwd} recorded inside the session.
 *
 * That is why both fields are on every summary, and why two listings exist:
 * `sessions:list` answers "this profile, this directory", and
 * `sessions:listAll` walks the whole space so a sidebar can group by project
 * and label by profile.
 *
 * **`cwd` is read from the session, never decoded from the directory name.**
 * The encoding replaces every non-alphanumeric character with `-`, so it is
 * lossy and ambiguous for any path containing a real hyphen.
